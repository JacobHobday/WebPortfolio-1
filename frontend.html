                        <li>- Proof read content </li>
                        <li>- Check markup indentation & readability</li>
                        <li>- Refactor CSS & remove redundant code</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        To begin with I started proof reading each article as reading each article via the page source can
                        effect the readability severly.
                        <br />A way in which I made the proof reading and alterations easier was by utilising the live server
                        function within Visual Studio.
                        <br />This uses your local loopback address which allows your system to send a message to itself or in
                        this case, host a webserver to itself.
                    </p>

                        alt="screenshot of loopback server being viewed in browser">
                    <p>
                        After correcting any grammatical errors I moved onto indenting my HTML to make it readable and
                        refactoring my CSS.
                        <br />Due to my media queries I had around 300 lines of redundant code which I have now removed.
                        <br />My refactored main.css is now only 129 lines, below is a preview of some of the code.

                        <h3>Submission Form</h3>
                        <p>
                            Creating a contact page with user input fields.
                        </p>
                    </header>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Setup contact page</li>
                        <li>- Insert form</li>
                        <li>- Add form input fields and labels.</li>
                        <li>- Create submit button</li>
                        <li>- Test form validation</li>
                        <li>- Improve look of form</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Firstly I opened the contact page and copied over the structure of the previously created pages to
                        maintain consistency.
                        <br />I then inserted a form with a method of "post", this relates to the HTTP verb POST, (Mdn, 2019)
                        have a list of verbs for reference.
                        <br />After setting up the basic submission form I created a fieldset containing two radio buttons,
                        allowing the user to choose whether to receive more information.
                        <br />In order for the user to be able to submit the form I have added an input element to the end with
                        the type variable set to "submit".
                    </p>
                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/form.jpg" alt="screenshot of markup for submission form">
                    <p>
                        Implementing form validation is very easy with HTML5, for the input that takes the users email address I
                        changed the type variable to "email".
                        <br />Testing the form validation required me to enter an invalid email address and see if the form
                        would check for errors.
                    </p>

                        alt="screenshot of form markup that validates user's email">
                    <p>
                        Finally to improve the look of the form I added a light grey background color to the input fields for
                        the users name and email.

                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        In order to make the images within the articles flexible I have set the width property to 100%.
                        <br />This will preserve the resolution when loaded by different media queries.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        To create a simple background image I used <a
                            href="http://www.stripegenerator.com/">http://www.stripegenerator.com/</a>.
                        <br />I created a "mediarticle" class, took the current background colour of my article divs and set the
                        stripes to grey.
                    </p>
                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/stripegen.jpg" alt="screenshot of stripe generator site">
                    <p>
                        Finally I created a favicon using the site <a href="https://favicon.io/">https://favicon.io/</a>.
                        <br />Choosing to generate the favicon from text allowed me to create a simple closing tag symbol.
                        <br />The favicon is located on the tab for this site.

                            Converting to a mobile first approach and supporting multiple devices.

                        <li>- Testing responsive web pages</li>

                    <p>
                        I started by implementing the CSS Grid to my articles and keeping the rest of the site minimal.
                        <br />A wrapper is used to initiate the grid display and define the column values.
                    </p>
                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/grid.jpg" alt="screenshot showing wrapper for CSS grid">
                    <p>
                        This can then be combined with media queries to determine how many columns and rows the site should
                        have.
                        <br />While researching I found a recommendation by (Clarke, 2012) on how many media queries to setup.
                        <br /> This is the mobile layout as I'm starting to implement the mobile first approach.

                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/query.jpg" alt="screenshot of media query">
                    <p>
                        When viewing this site on a mobile the timetable will be removed due to the display value being set to
                        none.
                        <br /> This just prevents the site from becoming too crowded when viewed on a smaller device.

                    <p>
                        To test whether the site works well across multiple devices I used <a
                            href="http://mobiletest.me/">mobiletest.me.</a>
                        <br /> This let me view the site on emulated devices.

                    <p>Here in the head section of the site I have created a link tag that includes google fonts.
                        <br />This will load the font family "Strait" into my HTML file via the google API.

                        Here I have set the line height for text on this site and ensured that the text is centred.
                        <br />For the article posts I have overridden this so that the text floats left as this makes them
                        easier to read.

                        alt="screenshot of code that shows how to float images">
                    <p>
                        To float an image and wrap some text around it I referred to <cite>(W3 Schools, 2019)</cite>.
                        <br />I initially got this wrong as I had the text before the image, which meant the text wouldn't wrap.
                        <br /> The image on the right inherits properties from both the "posts" and "floatexample" classes.
                        <br />This resulted in the footer also wrapping around the image.
                        <br />To fix this I defined a footer class called "clearexample" to clear both sides of the footer.
                        <br />In order to resolve the layout I added some padding to the "floatexample" class,
                        this prevented the image from hitting the border of the article.

                        this showed me a general way to layout the site.
                        <br />Below is the start of the main.css file, this stylesheet is loaded after normalise has corrected
                        the page.
                        <br />Within the body and the nav I have defined the font family, nav will override the body font.
                        <br />This is due to CSS specificity, this is "the set of rules applied to CSS selectors in order to
                        determine which style is applied to an element." (Bostian, 2019).

                        The definition lists were used to define the concepts covered in this blog, that being HTML & CSS.
                        <br />These defintions are located in the &lt;blockquote&gt; tags and are quotes from <a

                        <br />To finish off the definition list I added some images under <cite>(Creativecommons.org,
                            2016).</cite>
                        <br />In order to turn the images into links I embedded the image element within an anchor element.

                        <li>- Create navigation within each page using named anchors</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Firstly I setup an article structure consisting of a header with a title, a list and a footer with the
                        date embedded.
                        <br />I then moved onto adding a list which was straightforward, until I ran into the problem of HTML
                        being interpreted within this article's content when referring to the image tag.
                        <br />To circumvent this I utilised the named characters for "&lt;" & "&gt;" that are recognised by
                        HTML.
                        <br /><cite>(W3.org, 2019)</cite> have a character list to reference.
                    </p>
                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/markup.jpg" alt="screenshot of article containing a list">
                    <p>When adding an image, open an image tag and enter the path to the image file and add a descripton for
                        screen readers to use.</p>
                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/img.jpg" alt="screenshot of markup for implementing an image">
                    <p>
                        To format the publication date correctly I used the time tag along with the "datetime" variable.
                        Afterwards you can put the date in plain English before the closing time tag.
                    </p>
                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/date.jpg" alt="screenshot of time tag used for publication dates">
                    <p>
                        As this index page is going to contain lots of content, it would be good to have a way of going to the
                        top of the page without scrolling.
                        <br />To do this I created an anchor with the ID of 'top', this is not visible to the user as there is
                        no content between the tags.
                    </p>
                    <img class="posts" src="assets/images/anchor.jpg" alt="screenshot of anchor at top of page">
                    <p>
                        This other anchor located in the footer, is linked to the one at the top of the page allowing me to jump
                        to the top.
                    </p>

                        <h3>Getting Started</h3>
                        <p>
                            I first started by setting up a 3 page static site, this included ensuring each page responded
                            dynamically to the window size.
                        </p>
                    </header>
                    <ul>
                        <li>- Set up site folder</li>
                        <li>- Create index.html</li>
                        <li>- Create tutorial.html</li>
                        <li>- Set viewport scale</li>
                        <li>- Link files in a nav for navigation</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Since I do not have much experience with hosting a website I struggled to structure the directories
                        correctly.
                        <br />This meant that my index file wasn't loaded, to fix this I removed the nested folder so index is
                        now located in the "public_html" directory.
                    </p>

                    <p>Below you can see the meta tag to set the viewport value, this means that when the browser loads the site
                        it will retain the correct scale in relation to the viewport.
                        This will serve as the 'responsive' design for now.

                    <p>To link the files together I created a nav section within the header which has anchors to the tutorial &
                        contact page within the same directory. </p>
